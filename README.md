## ⚙️ Project Structure

The project is modular, following **Design by Contract** principles to ensure method and class reliability through preconditions, postconditions, and invariants:

- **JSPs**: Presentation layer for front-end views
- **Servlets**: Controllers to handle HTTP requests and coordinate between UI and business logic
- **POJOs**: Data modeling objects representing core entities
- **Interfaces & Implementors**: Define and implement business logic with contract-based validation
- **DAOs & DAO Implementors**: Data Access Objects for contract-enforced, consistent database interactions

### Key Technologies
- **Java** for backend logic
- **JSP/Servlets** for the presentation layer
- **MySQL** as the database
- **MVC + Design by Contract (DbC)** for structured, reliable architecture
